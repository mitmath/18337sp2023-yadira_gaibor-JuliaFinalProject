# Julia Final Project
DrawInitialParams.jl contains the parallelization of the algorithm to draw initial parameters from given distributions of progenitor
mass, orbital period, and mass ratio.

GSA_CEmodel.jl contains the global sensitivity analysis on the CE stage of binary evolution only. I also started working on finding the
optimal values for our 5 free parameters, but that part is still a work in progress.
